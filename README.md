This app is inspired from Google keep, an app capable of storing your notes or anything that you would like to store. 
Only core functionalities are implemented in this and there is a huge scope of improvement in this. Currently there is no backend in Phase #1.
Backend will be added with the capabilites to encrypt the user data so that their privacy is maintained.

If you want, you can use the app and modify according to your need.
